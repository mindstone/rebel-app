Use **CHIEF_ENGINEER (CE2)**, not CHIEF_BUGFIXER.

Read and follow:
- \`coding-agent-instructions/workflows/CHIEF_ENGINEER/CHIEF_ENGINEER_AUTONOMOUS.md\` (the autonomous-mode entry point you were dispatched under — it bakes \`bug_mode: true\` and the autonomous-checkpoint behaviour into CE2)
- \`coding-agent-instructions/workflows/CHIEF_ENGINEER/CHIEF_ENGINEER.md\` (the full workflow definition that AUTONOMOUS.md layers on top of)
- \`docs/project/CODING_PRINCIPLES.md\`

The CE2 \`bug_mode: true\` path covers diagnosis, multi-model review, and surgical fix — the same ground as CHIEF_BUGFIXER, with richer specialist coverage.

This is an unattended automated session. Do not ask the user questions. Follow CE2's autonomous behaviour at every checkpoint per AUTONOMOUS.md.

### Cost-Pruning Directives (autopilot-only)

When you create the planning doc at \`docs/plans/<slug>/PLAN.md\`, write the following keys into its YAML frontmatter so every subagent you dispatch sees them:

\`\`\`yaml
---
bug_mode: true
review_mode: light
---
\`\`\`

These cost-prune CE2 to the cheaper review/specialist coverage that the autopilot needs. \`bug_mode: true\` selects the bug-diagnosis specialist set; \`review_mode: light\` selects 1-2 reviewers with auto-escalation triggers, instead of the default heavy review pool. Subagents read the frontmatter when they re-enter the planning doc, so the directives propagate automatically — do not rely on inline prompt text for cost prunes.

You may also skip CE2 Phase 7 (final review) when diagnosis confidence is high and all reviewers concurred at \`light\` intensity, and use Pathologist-Lite (single specialist pass) instead of the full Pathologist sweep. These are autopilot-only escape valves; document the choice in your PLAN.md as a one-liner under \`## Notes\`.`;

Use **CHIEF_BUGFIXER**, not CHIEF_ENGINEER.

**Evidence retrieval: use Sentry REST directly.** All evidence-gathering for this session must use Sentry's REST API. Canonical endpoints (substitute \`\${SENTRY_API_BASE_URL}\` from your session environment — typically \`https://us.sentry.io\` for the regional deploy; do NOT hard-code \`https://sentry.io\` because regionalised orgs require the regional host to avoid redirect-driven auth failures):

- Event list (pattern-spotting across occurrences): \`GET \${SENTRY_API_BASE_URL}/api/0/issues/{issue_id}/events/?full=true&limit=10\`

- Recent releases: \`GET \${SENTRY_API_BASE_URL}/api/0/organizations/{org}/releases/?per_page=20\`

${fenced(reporterName || '(not provided)')}

### Draft User Response

After completing the investigation, write a draft response to:
\`${path.join(artifactDir, 'user_response_draft.md')}\`

The draft is written for a non-technical reader. The tone is warm, professional, and concise — like a polite product person, not an engineer. Do NOT include code, stack traces, error names, file paths, or jargon. Do NOT include a subject line; the draft is the message body only.

The draft must:
- Thank the reporter for taking the time to flag the issue
- Acknowledge the specific behaviour they described, in their own framing (no diagnostic vocabulary)
- Explain in plain language what was happening (one or two sentences max — what they would have noticed, not what the code was doing)
- Explain in plain language what we did about it (again, no technical detail)
- Close with a brief, friendly sign-off

${greetingGuidance}

**Timeline language — read carefully:**
- If, and only if, you have just auto-committed a fix to the \`dev\` branch in this session, you may say the fix will ship in the next release, "typically within a few days". Phrase it as a soft expectation, not a guarantee — never give a specific date.
- If the fix has NOT been committed to \`dev\` (e.g. you opened a PR, escalated to a human, or only produced a plan), do NOT promise any timeline. Say something like "we're working on it" or "the team is looking into it" without committing to when it will land.
- When in doubt, say less rather than more. A vague honest answer beats a specific one we can't keep.

## Autonomous Mode

This session was triggered by Sentry Autopilot. There is no human in the loop. Make all decisions autonomously from available evidence, and write artifacts for every exit path.

### Artifact Paths

- Artifact directory: \`${artifactDir}\`
- Outcome JSON: \`${path.join(artifactDir, 'outcome.json')}\`
- Plan file (CE2-native): write to \`docs/plans/<slug>/PLAN.md\` inside the worktree, where \`<slug>\` is a short kebab-case identifier for this fix. The autopilot harness snapshots the file to \`${path.join(artifactDir, 'plan.md')}\` before slot release so the reporter can read it after cleanup.
- Supervisor log: \`${path.join(artifactDir, 'supervisor.log')}\`

### Confidence-Based Output Policy

**HIGH CONFIDENCE (diagnosis confidence >= 90% AND all reviewers >= 90%):**
- Shadow mode: write a plan and outcome as if you would commit, but do not commit. Outcome: \`"plan_created"\` with \`"shadow_would_commit": true\`.
- Guarded mode: auto-commit only if the fix is single-file. Multi-file fixes become \`"plan_created"\`.
- Full mode: commit to the autopilot branch \`autopilot/sentry-${safePathSegment(promptIssue.sentryId)}\` (NOT \`dev\`). See "Autopilot Branch Convention" below for the checkout command.
- Commit message format: \`fix(<scope>): <description> (${promptIssue.sentryId}) [autopilot]\`
- Write \`outcome.json\` and include the \`branch_name\` field:
  \`{ "outcome": "auto_committed", "confidence": 95, "commit_hash": "abc1234", "branch_name": "autopilot/sentry-${safePathSegment(promptIssue.sentryId)}", "files_changed": ["src/foo.ts"] }\`

**BELOW THRESHOLD (diagnosis < 90%, any reviewer < 90% after refinement, not a bug, or requires architectural work):**
- Do not commit code.
- Write a detailed plan in CE2 format at \`docs/plans/<slug>/PLAN.md\` inside the worktree (use a short kebab-case slug like \`fix-${safePathSegment(promptIssue.sentryId).toLowerCase()}\`). Include root cause analysis, proposed fix, files to change, risks, and what prevented auto-commit. The CHIEF_ENGINEER_AUTONOMOUS.md doc references the planning template; \`coding-agent-instructions/workflows/CHIEF_ENGINEER/PLANNING_DOC_TEMPLATE.md\` (or whichever template AUTONOMOUS.md points at) is the source of truth for the plan structure.
- Remember to include the autopilot cost-prune frontmatter (\`bug_mode: true\`, \`review_mode: light\`) per the Critical Workflow Instruction above.
- Write \`outcome.json\`:
  \`{ "outcome": "plan_created", "confidence": 82, "plan_file": "docs/plans/<slug>/PLAN.md", "reason": "Below 90% confidence threshold" }\`
- If diagnosis confidence is below 70% or the issue is fundamentally unresolvable, escalate:
  \`{ "outcome": "escalated", "confidence": 55, "reason": "Divergent diagnosis" }\`

### Outcome Contract — outcome.json field types (STRICT)

The outcome JSON is validated against a typed contract (\`scripts/sentry-autopilot/outcome-schema.ts\`). Mistyped values on these known fields cause a terminal parse failure; the session is marked \`failed\` with \`failure_kind: 'parse_failure'\` and the issue does not progress.

**Canonical typed fields** — emit exactly these types:

- \`outcome\` — string literal, one of: \`"auto_committed"\`, \`"plan_created"\`, \`"escalated"\`, \`"not_a_bug"\`, \`"failed"\`. (Discriminator.)
- \`is_bug\` — JSON boolean (\`true\` or \`false\`). **Not a string.** Do NOT emit \`"yes"\`, \`"no"\`, \`"ambiguous"\`, \`"likely"\`, \`"no_likely_expected_behaviour"\`, or any other string. If you genuinely cannot decide, **omit the field** — the supervisor's \`is_bug_missing\` counter handles that path. Do NOT emit \`null\` either; omit the field instead.
- \`confidence\` — integer 0-100. Not a string, not a percentage with \`%\`, not a fraction (\`0.95\`), not a list of per-debugger numbers (use \`debugger_confidences\` as an extras key for that).${buildDiagnosisConfidenceContractClause(workflow)}
- \`diagnosis\` — JSON string up to 8000 characters. **Flat prose only — not an object.** If you have structured diagnostic data (\`root_cause\`, \`category\`, \`trigger_path\`, \`summary\`, \`evidence\`, \`debugger_consensus\`, etc.), summarise it in prose under \`diagnosis\` and put the structured form under a separate extras key called \`diagnosis_structured\`. The schema preserves \`diagnosis_structured\` as untyped extras (the agent's structured data is not lost).
- \`root_cause\` — JSON string up to 4000 characters. Same rule as \`diagnosis\`: flat string only, no nested objects.
- \`plan_summary\` — JSON string up to 4000 characters. Use this as the canonical prose summary of the plan. Prefer \`plan_summary\` over variants like \`fix_summary\`, \`proposed_fix_summary\`, or \`summary\` — those are accepted as extras but harder for the reporter to surface.
- \`files_changed\` — array of strings (max 50 entries). Repo-relative paths.
- \`commit_hash\` — string, 7-40 lowercase hex characters (\`auto_committed\` only). Must exist in the repo at the time of harvest.
- \`branch_name\` — string matching \`^autopilot/[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$\` (\`auto_committed\` only).
- \`plan_file\` — relative path to the plan file. Either the legacy literal \`"plan.md"\` (transitional, used by eval mode) OR the CE2-native shape \`"docs/plans/<slug>/PLAN.md"\` (preferred for CE2 sessions). Required on \`plan_created\`; optional on \`auto_committed\`. Must be a relative path under 512 chars with no \`..\` segments. Not \`"diagnosis.md"\`, \`"other.md"\`, absolute paths, etc.
- \`failure_kind\` — string, one of: \`"parse_failure"\`, \`"supervisor_failure"\`, \`"bugfixer_failure"\`, \`"reporter_failure"\`, \`"verification_failure"\` (\`failed\` only).
- \`error\` — JSON string up to 8000 characters (\`failed\` only). Required.
- \`reason\` — JSON string up to 2000 characters. **Required for \`escalated\`** (the schema rejects an \`escalated\` outcome with no \`reason\`). Optional context for \`plan_created\`, \`not_a_bug\`, \`failed\`.
- \`shadow_would_commit\` — JSON boolean. (Set on \`plan_created\` in shadow mode if the fix would otherwise meet the high-confidence commit gate.)
- \`sentry_id\` — string, optional on every branch. Not the same as the extras key \`sentry_short_id\` (which the agent often emits as the human-readable issue identifier).
- \`pr_url\` — string URL, optional on \`auto_committed\` only. Set when a PR was opened as part of the commit gate.
- \`original_outcome\` — string, optional/nullable on \`failed\` only. Set when a parse failure was promoted to \`failed\` and we want to preserve the agent's originally-claimed outcome value.
- \`exit_code\` — integer, optional on \`failed\` only. The bug-fixer process exit code, when known.

**Allowed extras** — anything else you want to emit as provenance, context, or evidence is accepted by the schema's \`.catchall(z.unknown())\` and **preserved** on the parsed outcome. Common examples observed in production: \`originating_commit\`, \`sentry_short_id\`, \`sentry_url\`, \`review_mode\`, \`investigation_mode\`, \`debuggers_consulted\`, \`debugger_confidences\`, \`diagnosis_structured\`, \`proposed_fix\`, \`reviewer_results\`, \`cluster_context\`, \`class_level_finding\`, \`follow_ups\`, \`verification_plan\`, \`risks\`, \`blockers_to_auto_commit\`, \`commit_message_draft\`.

**Two rules for extras:**

1. **Do not duplicate a typed field under a different name.** Emit \`is_bug: true\` — do not also emit \`bug_confirmed: "yes"\`. Emit \`commit_hash: "abc1234..."\` — do not also emit \`commit_sha\`, \`sha\`, \`commit\`. The schema preserves both, but consumers see the typed field; the duplicate is dead weight and risks future contract confusion.
2. **Do not use an extras key in place of a typed field.** Don't emit \`bug_confirmed: "yes"\` instead of \`is_bug: true\`. Don't emit \`diagnosis: { root_cause: "..." }\` instead of \`diagnosis: "...prose..."\` + \`diagnosis_structured: { root_cause: "..." }\`. The typed field MUST appear if you have a value for it; the extras key supplements, not substitutes.

**Worked example** (\`plan_created\` with structured diagnostic data):

\`\`\`json
{
  "outcome": "plan_created",
  "confidence": 95,
  "is_bug": true,
  "shadow_would_commit": true,
  "plan_file": "docs/plans/fix-app-tsx-connection-errors/PLAN.md",
  "reason": "Shadow mode — fix meets the high-confidence commit gate but commits are disabled.",
  "diagnosis": "Renderer Sentry-capture useEffect (App.tsx:1280-1306) filters billing/rate_limit/user_action errors but misses connection-not-configured, while the main process already suppresses that class via ConnectionNotConfiguredError. This is a parity drift introduced when main-side suppression landed without a matching renderer update.",
  "diagnosis_structured": {
    "root_cause": "App.tsx:1280-1306 missing connection-not-configured filter",
    "originating_commit": "e2f1eff3e",
    "bug_type": "incomplete_implementation",
    "trigger_path": ["..."],
    "evidence": {"...": "..."}
  },
  "plan_summary": "Add \`isExpectedUserStateErrorKind(kind)\` helper; consume in App.tsx error-capture useEffect alongside existing filters. Mirrors main-process suppression.",
  "files_changed": [
    "src/renderer/features/agent-session/utils/classifySessionError.ts",
    "src/renderer/App.tsx"
  ],
  "review_mode": "triple_parallel",
  "debuggers_consulted": ["debugger-gpt5.5-high", "debugger-gpt5.3-codex", "debugger-gemini3.1-pro"]
}
\`\`\`

The \`diagnosis\` is prose; \`diagnosis_structured\` (extras) carries the rich form. Both survive parse.

### Exit Protocol

Before exiting, always write \`outcome.json\` to the artifact directory. The session supervisor will write a fallback crash outcome if you fail to do so, but that is considered a failed session.

${buildAutopilotBranchSection(promptIssue.sentryId, config.pushMode, evalMode)}

${buildDeploymentPhaseSection(config.phase, promptIssue.sentryId, evalMode)}
${buildUserReportedSection(promptIssue, artifactDir)}
`;

  fs.writeFileSync(promptPath, prompt);
  return promptPath;
}
