/**
 * Safe Directory Walker
 *
 * A bounded, cycle-safe alternative to ad-hoc `fs.readdir` recursion.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 * - User workspaces can contain real-directory loops or symlinks-to-ancestor
 *   that are completely valid on disk but blow up any naïve walker with
 *   `ENAMETOOLONG: name too long` once the synthesized path crosses the OS
 *   PATH_MAX (1024 on macOS, 4096 on Linux, 260 on Windows by default).
 * - Sentry cluster REBEL-4WS through REBEL-510 (~100 issues) and the
 *   recurrence in REBEL-506 came from one user's self-nested workspace
 *   tripping every walker that descends from the workspace root.
 * - Each previous fix patched ONE walker. This utility centralises the
 *   defence so every recursive walker in the codebase gets the same guards
 *   and a single regression suite covers them all.
 *
 * Guards (all enforced internally):
 * 1. **Visited-realpath set** — breaks symlink-to-ancestor loops AND real-
 *    directory loops introduced by the user (same canonical path reached
 *    twice). The proven mechanism from `listMarkdownFilesRecursively`.
 * 2. **Depth cap** — hard limit on tree depth.
 * 3. **Path-length cap** — bails before any path string approaches OS
 *    PATH_MAX, so we never make the syscall that would return ENAMETOOLONG.
 * 4. **Entries cap** — defence in depth against pathological fan-out.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```ts
 * await safeWalkDirectory(rootDir, {
 *   onFile: ({ absolutePath, name }) => {
 *     if (name.endsWith('.md')) results.push(absolutePath);
 *   },
 *   onDirectory: ({ name }) =>
 *     name.startsWith('.') ? false : true, // skip hidden dirs
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Defaults are the same proven values from `listMarkdownFilesRecursively`
 * and are appropriate for any walker rooted at a workspace or space root.
 * Callers with very specific needs can override per-call.
 *
 * Planning context:
 * - REBEL-506 fix (this file is the catch-all)
 * - Previous walker-specific fix: commit 4d8981cd2
 * - Sentry triage: docs-private/sentry-triage-log/260427_111800_harry_triage.md

 * ABANDON (runWithTimeout left the wedged syscall parking a libuv worker) to RECLAIM
 * (the boundary's killable child pool kills the wedged child and frees the slot).
 *
 * Classification stays split, deliberately (S4 review R-MUST-2 / design D1):
 *   - CONTAINMENT (`classifyWorkspacePath` = `isUnderCloudSpace`, the boundary's
 *     default) routes every read UNDER a configured cloud space to the cloud lane.
 *   - PATTERN (`detectCloudStorage`, via `cloudLaneOptionForPath` → `forceCloud`)
 *     bridges the EXPLICIT-cloud-root carve-out: an on-demand `ls`/`glob` of a cloud
 *     folder that is NOT a configured space classifies `'local'` by containment, so
 *     the walker forces the cloud lane from its own pattern evidence. Without this the
 *     carve-out would silently regress to UNBOUNDED bare fs.

   * realpath, every directory enumeration, and every per-entry stat/realpath in the
   * walk (merged with each path's OWN pattern evidence so neither source is lost).
   * Mirrors how `readSpaceReadmeBounded` got its `forceCloud` option (260622 rd4 — the
