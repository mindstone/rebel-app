/**
 * cloudSubprocessExclusion — make the subprocess search tiers (`rg`/`find`/`grep`)
 * honor the same incidental-cloud-symlink skip policy the shared Node walker
 * (`safeWalkDirectory`) enforces by default.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM (GPT-F3, Stage 9): a workspace-wide recursive glob or `searchFiles`
 * from a NON-cloud root can wander into an INCIDENTAL cloud symlink (e.g.
 * `work/Mindstone/General → ~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-…`). `rg --follow`
 * / `find -L` follow that symlink into a dead/unresponsive FUSE mount and hang the
 * subprocess (and thus the tool call). These tiers BYPASS `safeWalkDirectory`'s
 * default-on `skipCloudSymlinkTargets`, so they get no protection today.
 *
 * THE FIX (consistent with the established policy): before running the subprocess,
 * enumerate the search root's IMMEDIATE entries with `readdirSync` and classify each
 * symlink READLINK-ONLY (`walkToFirstCloudHopViaReadlink` — NEVER `realpath`/`stat`
 * the target, which is the dead-mount touch we must avoid). An incidental cloud
 * symlink that is NOT admitted (flag off, or verdict not `healthy`) becomes an
 * exclusion the caller passes to the subprocess (`rg --glob '!<rel>/**'`,
 * `find … -path '<abs>' -prune`), so the subprocess never descends into the dead
 * mount. The subprocess is independently time-bounded (its existing `timeout`
 * option) as defence-in-depth.
 *
 * The carve-outs match `safeWalkDirectory` exactly:
 *  - **Explicit named-cloud root** — if the search ROOT is itself cloud-classified
 *    (the user/agent explicitly named a cloud folder), we do NOT enumerate it
 *    (that readdir would itself be the hang) and produce NO exclusions — the
 *    caller searches it (bounded by the subprocess timeout). On-demand named-cloud
 *    access keeps working.
 *  - **Admission** — when `isCloudSymlinkIndexingEnabled()` AND the space's verdict
 *    is `healthy`, the cloud symlink is ADMITTED (not excluded) just like the
 *    walker, so a healthy Drive space is still searched.
 *  - **Non-cloud outside-workspace symlinks** (`rebel-system → /Applications/…`)
 *    classify `local-terminus` → never excluded (followed as today).
 *
 * Pure / synchronous-classification: `readdirSync` + `readlinkSync` only on the
 * LOCAL root and LOCAL link inodes; no `electron` import; safe in `src/core/`.
