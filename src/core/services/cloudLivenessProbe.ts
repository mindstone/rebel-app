/**
 * cloudLivenessProbe — `@core` boundary interface for deciding whether a
 * cloud-storage–backed symlink target is currently HEALTHY, without ever issuing
 * an unbounded blocking syscall against the (possibly dead) mount on the main
 * thread.
 *
 * The desktop implementation (Stage 2) owns a long-lived child PROCESS that does
 * all cloud-mount filesystem probing, with the per-probe timeout + kill-and-
 * respawn living in the PARENT — the only mechanism the Stage-0 spike proved
 * actually isolates a wedged syscall (worker_threads share the global libuv pool
 * and are un-killable when blocked). Cloud/mobile have no FUSE mounts, so they
 * keep the no-op default forever.
 *
 * This Stage-1 file is the CONTRACT ONLY: the interface, a module-singleton
 * setter/getter (mirroring `broadcastService.ts` / `errorReporter.ts`), and a
 * default `unknown`-returning no-op probe installed AT MODULE IMPORT. No probing
 * engine, no process spawn, no consumer wiring — inert by construction
 * (default `unknown` == today's behaviour: nothing admitted, nothing purged).
 *
 * RS-F5 (critical, the deliberate difference from broadcastService/errorReporter):
 * the consult is a TOTAL function. `broadcastService` THROWS when unwired; here a
 * throw on the hot descent/purge path could be caught upstream and wrongly
 * default to admit/purge — re-opening the hang and the index-wipe. So
 * `getCloudLivenessProbe()` ALWAYS returns a usable probe, and both
 * `getCachedVerdict` and `probeHealth` are wrapped so ANY internal error
 * resolves/returns `'unknown'`. `unknown` ⇒ callers exclude + retain
 * (fail-closed both ways).
 *
 * No `electron` import; safe in `src/core/`.
