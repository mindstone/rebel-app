 * `useOnboardingFlow → toolAuthMachine → toolAuthTypes` is acyclic, whereas
 * having the machine import the types from the hook (which imports the machine
 * back) was a circular dependency. Consumers continue to import these types
 * from `./useOnboardingFlow`, which re-exports them — see invariant #2 in
 * `docs/plans/260608_onboarding-flow-state-machine/PLAN.md`.
