/**
 * Pure copy decision for the `bug-report:status` broadcast toast (App.tsx
 * listener). Extracted so the user-facing copy — especially the honest
 * delivery-status branches — is regression-testable without App churn.
 *
 * Payload shape mirrors `BugReportStatusPayload` (src/main/ipc/
 * bugReportHandlers.ts; channel is not in the typed broadcast registry).
 *
 * Status vocabulary (Stage 5 — honest delivery status):
 * - 'queued'               → the report was durably saved to the on-disk outbox
 *                            (`accepted` returned). Fires ONE positive toast.
 * - 'delivered'            → confirmed 2xx after flush. A SILENT upgrade: this
 *                            helper returns `null` so no second toast fires (the
 *                            queued toast already gave confidence; a delivered
 *                            toast would be noise and undermine the first).
 * - 'delivery-unavailable' → Sentry off / no-DSN, OR dead-letter after retries
 *                            exhausted. Warning toast with a Copy-report action
 *                            (environment-independent) + Rebels-community pointer.
 * - 'failed'               → even the durable save failed (disk full). Error toast.
 *
 * `reason` is present only for status 'delivery-unavailable':
 * - 'no-dsn'                 → this build shipped without error reporting
 *                              configured (NOT a dev-mode situation) — never
 *                              mention dev mode.
 * - 'env-disabled'           → the dev default / explicit SENTRY_ENABLED opt-out.
 * - 'dead-letter'            → delivery retries exhausted.
 * - 'oss-egress-unavailable' → open-build local-only state; reports are not sent
 *                              to Mindstone while OSS egress is gated off.
 * The non-OSS copy is identical across reasons (the user need not know WHY the
 * team couldn't be reached, only that their report is safe and Rebel will keep
 * trying); the reason is preserved for forward-compat / logging.
 *
 * `reportText`, when present (forwarded by the main-process broadcast for the
 * delivery-unavailable case), is the raw report the user wrote. The pure module
 * does not perform clipboard I/O — instead it flags `action: 'copy-report'` so
 * the App.tsx listener can wire an environment-independent "Copy report" toast
 * action over the forwarded text.
