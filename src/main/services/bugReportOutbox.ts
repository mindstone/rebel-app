/**
 * Bug Report Outbox
 *
 * Durable, disk-backed outbox for user bug reports. This is the by-construction
 * R1/R2 net for the "Feedback & Bugs" path: once a user submits and sees a
 * confirmation, the raw report is persisted to disk BEFORE we return `accepted`,
 * then drained with retry until Sentry confirms a 2xx transport outcome.
 * Offline, transport failure, app quit, or even power loss can no longer lose a
 * submitted report.*
 *
 * (* Power-loss durability is POSIX-only: it relies on a parent-directory fsync
 * after the rename, which is unsupported on Windows. Windows still gets
 * crash-safety — temp-file + filehandle.sync() + crash-safe `.bak` replace — but
 * NOT the directory-entry power-loss guarantee. See "## Power-loss durability".)
 *
 * ## Why a bespoke per-file store (not assetUploadOutbox)
 *
 * `assetUploadOutbox.ts` keeps its queue in memory and re-derives state on boot
 * from an EXTERNAL source of truth (the asset store) — it has no payload-to-disk
 * layer. A bug report's TEXT is the only artifact, so we must persist the
 * payload itself. We therefore reuse the genuine persist-to-disk primitives from
 * the `cloudOutbox.ts` / `pending*Store.ts` family — atomic write, `.corrupt`
 * quarantine on unreadable/torn files, Zod-validate-on-read, byte caps — laid
 * out as ONE JSON file per report under `userData/bug-report-outbox/`. The
 * lifecycle shell (start / stop / backoff / drain) is borrowed conceptually from
 * `assetUploadOutbox`.
 *
 * ## Power-loss durability
 *
 * `src/main/utils/atomicFs.ts#writeFileAtomic` does temp-file + rename, which
 * survives a process crash but NOT a power loss (the temp file's bytes may still
 * be in the OS write-back cache when the rename's directory entry is flushed).
 * Because "robust by construction" is the explicit goal here, this module writes
 * the temp file and `filehandle.sync()`s it (fsync) BEFORE the rename, so the
 * payload bytes are on stable storage before the rename makes them visible, and
 * then fsyncs the PARENT DIRECTORY after the rename so the new directory entry
 * is itself durable (on some filesystems a rename can otherwise be lost on power
 * loss even though the file bytes survived). Directory fsync is skipped on
 * Windows (opening a directory for fsync is unsupported there) and is best-
 * effort everywhere — it never discards an otherwise-successful write.
 *
 * On Windows, `rename` fails if the destination exists, so an update of an
 * already-`accepted` record (retry bookkeeping / dead-letter parking) preserves
 * the live copy as `<id>.json.bak` until the replacement is durable, then
 * removes the backup. A crash mid-replace leaves a recoverable copy as either
 * `<id>.json` or its `.bak`; the boot/drain scan recovers a stranded `.bak`
 * (`recoverWindowsBackups`). The previous unlink-before-rename had a window
 * where a crash destroyed the only durable copy.
 *
 * ## schemaVersion (NOT a *STORE_VERSION constant)
 *
 * Each record carries a per-record `schemaVersion: 1`. This is deliberately NOT
 * registered in `ALL_STORE_VERSIONS` (`src/core/constants.ts`): doing so would
 * couple it to the `check-store-versions` gate and a `DATA_SCHEMA_EPOCH` bump,
 * whose cross-worktree login-breakage cost is not justified for an ephemeral
 * delivery queue. Old/unreadable records are quarantined to `.corrupt`, not
 * migrated — the queue is transient, not user state.
 *
 * ## Idempotency invariant
 *
 * Every record carries a FIXED `eventId` (32-char hex). All delivery attempts —
 * the immediate one and every retry — submit with the SAME `eventId`, so a retry
 * after a pre-delete crash dedups server-side in Sentry (no second issue). The
 * outbox never re-mints the id.
 *
 * ## Drain wakes (there is NO online/offline signal in main/core)
 *
 * The drain is woken by: (1) immediate-on-enqueue, (2) a boot directory scan in
 * `start()`, (3) a backoff re-fire timer, and (4) `powerMonitor.resume`. There
 * is intentionally NO "network-recovery" event — none exists at this layer.
