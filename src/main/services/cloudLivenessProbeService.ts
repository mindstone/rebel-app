/**
 * cloudLivenessProbeService — desktop implementation of the Stage-1
 * `CloudLivenessProbe` interface (`@core/services/cloudLivenessProbe`).
 *
 * Owns a long-lived child PROCESS (`utilityProcess.fork` of
 * `cloudLivenessWorker.js`) that does all cloud-mount filesystem probing. The
 * per-probe timeout + kill-and-respawn live HERE, in the parent — the only
 * mechanism the Stage-0 spike proved actually isolates a wedged syscall:
 *
 *  - worker_threads share the process-global libuv threadpool and are
 *    un-killable when syscall-blocked → ruled out;
 *  - `runWithTimeout` (`Promise.race`) resolves on timeout but ABANDONS the
 *    underlying `fs.stat`, keeping a libuv worker parked → insufficient alone;
 *  - only SIGKILLing the child OS process reclaims the parked worker.
 *
 * Lifecycle is modelled on the three existing precedents:
 *  - `embeddingService` — long-lived crash/respawn + cooldown backoff;
 *  - `preTurnWorkerService` — `getElectronModule()` gating (disabled on
 *    cloud/headless) + packaged `app.asar.unpacked/workers` path resolution;
 *  - the `runIndexHealthCheckWithTimeout` shape in `index.ts` — kill-on-hang.
 *
 * STILL UNWIRED from descent/purge (Stage 4+). Spawning happens LAZILY on the
 * first `probeHealth`, so importing/registering this service is inert until
 * something actually probes — keeping the pre-Stage-7 behaviour exactly today's.
 *
 * RS-F4: on child SIGKILL/exit/crash, EVERY in-flight `probeHealth` promise is
 * drained to `degraded` (invert embeddingService's reject-pending pattern) so a
 * Stage-3 awaiter never leaks/hangs.
 *
 * Stage 3 (260619_cloud-symlink-indexing) layers the RECOVERY behaviour on top of
 * the Stage-2 engine, all inside this one retained instance:
 *  - real verdict TTLs (healthy ~45s); a non-healthy verdict has a short TTL so the
 *    hot-path `getCachedVerdict` re-reads `unknown` rather than a stale `degraded`.
 *    (S4.2: the per-target EXPONENTIAL BACKOFF re-probe + the auto-recovery/degrade
 *    transition callbacks were RETIRED — the cloud periodic re-walk scheduler
 *    re-probes ALL cloud targets each tick and drives the recovery re-walk.)
 *  - cold-start `prewarm(targets)` so a healthy Drive is verified within ONE
 *    launch (DA-2: the cold-start-dark-Drive bug), off-thread, never blocks boot;
 *  - a producer-side flap-debounced `getDisplayVerdict` (stable status for the
 *    Stage-8 UI) — distinct from the RAW un-debounced `getCachedVerdict` that
 *    admission/purge read for the immediate truth;
 *  - `invalidateVerdict(target)` for event-driven re-probe (workspace re-scan,
 *    watcher error).
 * RAW `getCachedVerdict` stays SYNCHRONOUS + UN-DEBOUNCED — admission/purge want
 * the immediate truth. The main thread never blocks on a mount on any path.
 *
 * Desktop-only (`utilityProcess`). Never loaded by core/cloud — the
 * transitive-electron-deps gate keeps `src/core` clean; this file lives in
 * `src/main`.

   * vs the 360s admission reader. If a short-TTL reader evicted a still-admission-valid
   * healthy entry, the admission read an instant later would miss → `unknown` → empty
   * cards reopen intermittently (the very regression this fix exists to prevent).
   *
   * So eviction is keyed by the MAXIMUM tolerance any reader uses:
   *  - a HEALTHY entry is only DELETED once `age > ADMISSION_VERDICT_TTL_MS` (360s, the
   *    widest healthy window) — below that it stays in the map for the admission reader;
   *  - a DEGRADED/unknown entry is DELETED once `age > DEGRADED_VERDICT_TTL_MS` (5s,
   *    unchanged) — a dead mount still self-heals fast and flips out of admission.
   *
   * RETURN semantics are unchanged per caller: this returns `'unknown'` whenever
   * `age > returnHealthyTtl` (the CALLER's own effective TTL), even though the entry is
   * not deleted. So a bare 45s reader still SEES `unknown` at age>45s (containment /
   * coverage / purge behaviour byte-identical), while the 360s admission reader SEES
   * the healthy verdict it kept alive. The reported `ageMs` is the true age (or
   * `+Infinity` when the read's own TTL is exceeded), so the purge-detail caller's

/**
 * Cold-start prewarm target derivation (DA-2). Derive the cloud-mount targets to
 * probe at cold start, **WITHOUT any main-thread blocking filesystem call on a
 * cloud-classified path** (Stage-3 refinement F2).
 *
 * THE F2 INVARIANT: the previous implementation `readdirSync`'d the workspace root
 * to enumerate symlinks. But a real user's `coreDirectory` can itself be a
 * cloud-classified path (PLAN line 67: `~/.../Dropbox/...`, or set under
 * `~/Library/CloudStorage/<Provider>-<Account>/…`, a network-backed FUSE mount).
 * A bare `readdirSync` there blocks the main thread unbounded in the kernel — the
 * exact libuv-pool hang this whole plan exists to kill, fired 8s post-boot.
 *
 * So we DO NOT enumerate the root via the filesystem. The candidate symlink LINK
 * paths come FS-FREE from settings `spaces` (`isSymlink` spaces). Target derivation
 * then splits on whether the WORKSPACE ROOT is itself cloud-classified:
 *
 *  - LOCAL ROOT (the common case): walk the chain with
 *    `walkToFirstCloudHopViaReadlink` via {@link mintFirstCloudHopTargetSync} —
 *    `readlinkSync` ONLY, reads the LINK's own inode (which lives in the LOCAL
 *    workspace dir / a LOCAL alias dir), never `realpath`/`stat`/`access` and never
 *    `readlinkSync` PAST a cloud hop. Stops AT the first cloud hop and returns THAT
 *    target — the path we want the OFF-THREAD prober to check. Chained-alias safe
 *    (F1): `workspace/link → ~/DriveAlias → ~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-…`
 *    resolves to the Drive hop, not silently dropped. DEAD-mount targets ARE
 *    returned — we WANT to probe them so they get a `degraded` verdict + recovery.
 *
 *  - CLOUD ROOT (the fix; PLAN Stage 2): the link inode itself lives IN the cloud
 *    root, so even a `readlinkSync` on it could block a dead FUSE mount. So we do
 *    NOT readlink here — we mint the probe target from the cached `space.sourcePath`
 *    via {@link mintCloudHopTargetFromKnownCloudPath}, a PURE STRING read of
 *    in-memory settings (ZERO filesystem I/O). Eligible only when `sourcePath` is
 *    an absolute cloud path; otherwise that one space is skipped (never a readlink
 *    under a possibly-dead root). The OLD behaviour skipped prewarm ENTIRELY under a
 *    cloud root, which left healthy cloud-symlinked Spaces permanently `unknown` →
 *    never admitted → rendered empty (the bug this stage fixes).
 *
 * Note: on ANY `coreDirectory`, the main thread issues NO `readdir`/`stat`/`access`
 * on a cloud mount, and NO `readlink` against a cloud-classified ROOT — the
 * main-thread-never-blocks invariant holds by construction.
 *
 * Keying: BOTH paths mint via helpers that yield a byte-identical key to what the
 * descent mints from the live link — the local path via the SAME readlink walker,
 * the cloud path via the cached `sourcePath` (which, for a direct cloud symlink, IS
 * the raw absolute readlink target the walker returns verbatim) — so the
 * prewarm-populated verdict is read back under the same key by construction.
 *
 * @param coreDirectory absolute workspace root — used ONLY for `path.join` of
 *   relative space paths (no filesystem touch).
 * @param spaces the configured spaces from settings (FS-free source of truth for
 *   which workspace entries are symlinks). `undefined`/empty → no targets.
