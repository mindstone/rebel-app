/**
 * cloudPeriodicRewalkService — the periodic re-walk scheduler for the
 * `260619_cloud-symlink-indexing` feature (S4.3). It REPLACES, in spirit, two
 * pieces of the "heavy machinery" S4.2 deletes:
 *
 *  1. the prober's decaying-backoff re-probe (`scheduleReprobe`) — each tick
 *     re-probes EVERY known cloud target, so a dead/recovering mount keeps getting
 *     checked without a per-target backoff timer; and
 *  2. the recovery re-index (`fireRecovery` → `restartCurrent` + reindex) — when a
 *     tick observes ANY cloud target healthy, it schedules ONE coalesced re-walk so
 *     a recovered mount's content rejoins the index.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT replace de-admission watcher retraction (gone once cloud
 * is never live-watched — S4.2/DROP-3) nor absence-purge (retain, no auto-purge in
 * v1 — PLAN invariant 3). A degraded mount is simply retried next tick; its
 * last-known index is retained, never purged.
 *
 * ── DESIGN CONTRACT (binding revisions from the S4.3 cross-family review) ──
 *  - R6 (flag-OFF neutrality): the tick re-reads `isEnabled()` FIRST and STRICTLY —
 *    with the flag off it does NO work beyond an inert, `.unref()`'d timer (no target
 *    derivation, no probe, no re-walk). `getCloudTargets()→[]` is only a SECOND guard.
 *  - R1 (settled verdicts): the tick `await`s `probeHealth()` for its targets before
 *    deciding to re-walk. The prober's `prewarm`/`getCachedVerdict` are
 *    fire-and-forget, so checking the cache immediately after a prewarm would miss a
 *    just-recovered mount and slip recovery to the next interval.
 *  - R2 (real re-walk): `rewalk()` must be a forced, NON-CLEARING discovery pass that
 *    bypasses the startup skip heuristic — `fileWatcherService.discoverWorkspaceNow()`,
 *    NOT `reindexWorkspace(false)` (which commonly skips discovery entirely).
 *  - R3 (S4.3 was purely additive): S4.3 left the legacy prober recovery/degrade
 *    machinery + `restartCurrent` in place and ran this scheduler alongside it. S4.2
 *    then deleted that legacy machinery and rewired the admission flag-flip caller
 *    onto `triggerRewalk` (below) — the one explicit re-walk push the scheduler now
 *    exposes (recovery itself stays tick-only, Q1).
 *  - R4 (target enumeration): callers pass a readlink-only "all cloud targets"
 *    enumerator (`deriveCloudPrewarmTargets`) — FS-free, returns dead targets too
 *    (we WANT to probe them), with no coupling to the absence-producer's purge
 *    semantics.
 *
 * The single-flight + trailing-coalesce below is COPIED (not imported) from
 * `cloudRecoveryReindex.ts` so S4.2 can delete that file without touching this one.
 *
 * `src/main` only: it drives the desktop file watcher. Cloud/mobile don't run a
 * local chokidar workspace watcher, so there is nothing to periodically re-walk
 * there. Triggers are INJECTED so the gating/coalescing is unit-testable without the
 * real watcher or prober.

 * v1 interval: 5 minutes. The dropped `scheduleReprobe` backoff capped near ~120s,
 * but it only re-probed individual dead targets; this tick can drive a
 * full-workspace re-walk, so a tighter cadence would over-churn. The retained index
 * makes ≤5-min recovery latency tolerable (S4.3 review Q2).
 *
 * COUPLED INVARIANT (260624): `ADMISSION_VERDICT_TTL_MS` (`src/core/constants.ts`,

 * survives the gap between re-probes (otherwise the Library empty-cards gap re-opens).
