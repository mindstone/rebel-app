# Help-for-Humans Update Process

A periodic workflow for ensuring `rebel-system/help-for-humans/` documentation stays accurate and comprehensive for end users and the Rebel agent.

## See Also

- [HELP_FOR_HUMANS_DOCUMENTATION](./HELP_FOR_HUMANS_DOCUMENTATION.md) — **Canonical writing guide**, quality checklist, and internal-to-user doc mapping
- [REBEL_SYSTEM_FILES](./REBEL_SYSTEM_FILES.md) — Directory structure and audience distinction
- [CHANGELOG_UPDATE_PROCESS](./CHANGELOG_UPDATE_PROCESS.md) — Changelog style and dual-changelog system
- [signposting-to-single-source-of-truth](../../rebel-system/skills/documentation/signposting-to-single-source-of-truth/SKILL.md) — Cross-referencing without duplication

> **Model routing**: run the Phase 3 per-area audits across agents in parallel, using a not-too-expensive model for large trawls (e.g. **Cursor Composer**); reserve frontier models for the Phase 5 review gate — **GPT by default, Opus for contested calls**. See [MODEL_ROSTER](../../coding-agent-instructions/workflows/CHIEF_ENGINEER/MODEL_ROSTER.md).


## When to Run This Process

- **After major releases** — When new features ship that users or the agent should know about
- **Periodically** — Monthly or quarterly review to catch drift
- **After changelog updates** — Cross-reference recent changes to ensure docs reflect them


## Process Overview

### Phase 1: Gather Context

1. **Review recent changes**:
   - Read `CHANGELOG.md` for recent user-facing changes
   - Read `rebel-system/help-for-humans/changelog.md` for what's already documented
   - Note features/changes that may need doc updates

2. **Inventory current docs**:
   - List all files in `rebel-system/help-for-humans/`
   - Identify which feature areas each doc covers
   - Note any obvious gaps (features without docs)

3. **Cross-reference with codebase**:
   - Check `docs/project/` for features that should have user-facing equivalents
   - Review Settings UI, onboarding flow, and major features for coverage


### Phase 2: Plan Updates

For each doc area, determine:

| Action | When |
|--------|------|
| **Update existing doc** | Feature exists, doc exists but is outdated |
| **Create new doc** | Feature exists, no doc covers it |
| **Refactor/split doc** | Doc covers too much or is poorly organized |
| **Delete doc** | Feature removed or doc is redundant — **requires discussion** |
| **No change needed** | Doc is accurate and complete |

**Important**: Major refactors or deletions should be discussed with the team before proceeding. Flag these for review rather than acting unilaterally.


### Phase 3: Execute Updates

Spawn agents by feature area to work in parallel:

**Agent prompt template:**
```
Audit and update help-for-humans docs for [FEATURE AREA].

Context:
- Read REBEL_SYSTEM_FILES.md for writing guidelines
- Review recent CHANGELOG.md entries for [FEATURE AREA]
- Compare against codebase (docs/project/[RELATED_DOC].md, relevant src/ code)

Tasks:
1. Read current help-for-humans doc(s) for this area
2. Identify what's outdated, missing, or incorrect
3. Update docs following REBEL_SYSTEM_FILES.md guidelines
4. Add cross-references to related help docs where helpful
5. Ensure YAML frontmatter has accurate description

Output:
- Summary of changes made
- Any issues requiring human discussion (deletions, major refactors)
```


### Phase 4: Review & Commit

1. **Self-review**: Check all updated docs against the quality checklist in REBEL_SYSTEM_FILES.md
2. **Cross-reference check**: Ensure links between docs are bidirectional where appropriate
3. **Commit**: Use descriptive commit message summarizing areas updated
4. **Submodule update**: Push rebel-system changes, update pointer in main repo


## Guidelines for Specific Actions

### Adding New Docs

When a feature needs a new help doc:

1. Check if it should be a standalone doc or a section in an existing doc
2. Follow the signposting principle — link to related docs, don't duplicate
3. Add cross-references FROM existing docs TO the new doc
4. Use YAML frontmatter with description
5. Match the naming convention: `feature-name.md` (hyphenated, lowercase)

### Updating Existing Docs

1. Preserve the existing structure where it works well
2. Update outdated information; don't just append
3. Remove obsolete content (features that no longer exist)
4. Update cross-references if related features changed

### Refactoring Docs

For minor refactoring (within a single doc):
- Proceed if it improves clarity or organization
- Note the change in commit message

For major refactoring (splitting, merging, renaming):
- **Flag for discussion** before proceeding
- Document the proposed change and rationale
- Wait for approval before executing

### Deleting Docs

**Always flag for discussion**. Reasons to delete:
- Feature was removed from the app
- Content was merged into another doc
- Doc is completely redundant

Provide:
- Which doc to delete
- Why it's no longer needed
- Where users should look instead (if applicable)


## Changelog Cross-Reference

When auditing, use the changelogs as a source of truth for recent changes:

1. **Internal changelog** (`CHANGELOG.md`): Has detailed timestamps and covers developer-facing changes too
2. **User changelog** (`rebel-system/help-for-humans/changelog.md`): Already summarized for users

Focus on `[User-facing]` entries from the internal changelog that might need deeper documentation beyond the changelog entry.


## User-Facing Language Guidelines

The user changelog and help docs are read by non-technical users. Avoid leaking implementation details:

**Never mention:**
- Internal tooling names (Squirrel, Electron Forge, Vite, etc.)
- Package managers or build systems (npm, webpack, etc.)
- Programming language internals (Python PATH, Node.js, etc.)
- OS-specific developer concepts (Microsoft Store app aliases, symlinks, etc.)
- Internal component names or architecture terms

**Instead, describe the user impact:**
| Technical reality | User-facing description |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| "Fixed Squirrel update paths" | "Connectors repair themselves after app updates" |
| "Python PATH conflict with MS Store" | Skip entirely, or "Scripts run more reliably" |
| "Electron IPC race condition" | "Startup is more reliable" |
| "Zod schema validation" | Skip entirely (internal) |

**Rule of thumb:** If a user would need to Google the term to understand it, rephrase or omit it.


## Phase 5: GPT Accuracy Review

Before committing, spawn `researcher-gpt5.5-high` (escalate to Opus for contested or high-stakes calls) to review all proposed doc changes for factual accuracy, correct user-facing language, and adherence to the guidelines above. Incorporate any corrections before proceeding.
